# coding-notes

I'm building my own library of notes on programming languages. Feel free to fork the repo, make pull requests, post issues, and drop a star.

If you have notes on a programming language that you want to contribute, please create a new file in the appropriate language folder and submit a pull request.

Thanks and happy coding!
