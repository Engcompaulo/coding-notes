# Creating a Simple Web Server in Node.js

## Overview
Node.js makes it straightforward to build web servers due to its asynchronous, event-driven architecture. This guide will show you how to create a basic web server using the native HTTP module provided by Node.js, which can handle HTTP requests and send responses back to clients.

## The HTTP Module
Node.js includes an HTTP module right out of the box, which can create an HTTP server listening for requests on a given port. This module provides a way of making Node.js transfer data over HTTP with ease.

## Creating a Web Server
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on setting up a simple web server:

### Step 1: Initialize a New Node.js Project
First, create a new directory for your project and initialize it with a `package.json` file:
```bash
mkdir my-web-server
cd my-web-server
npm init -y
```

### Step 2: Create the Server File
Create a file named `server.js` in your project directory:
```javascript
const http = require('http');

// Define the server port and IP
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

// Create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200; // HTTP status code 200 OK
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain'); // Set the header content-type
    res.end('Hello World\n'); // Send the response body "Hello World"
});

// Start the server
server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

### Step 3: Run the Server
To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
node server.js
```
This will start the server on localhost at port 3000. You can access the server in your web browser by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Testing the Server
Open your preferred web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. You should see the text "Hello World" displayed in the browser, which confirms that the server is running correctly and able to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Understanding the Code
The `http.createServer()` method turns your computer into an HTTP server. The `createServer()` method creates an HTTP Server object. The function passed into `http.createServer()` is a callback that gets executed each time someone tries to access the server.

- `req` (request) argument represents the request from the client, as an object (http.IncomingMessage object).
- `res` (response) argument is used to send back a response to the client.

## Conclusion
Building a web server with Node.js using the HTTP module is simple and only requires a few lines of code. This server can be extended to serve HTML pages, handle different types of requests, and send various responses, forming the backbone of a basic web application.
