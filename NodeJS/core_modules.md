# Core Modules in Node.js

## Overview
Node.js comes with a rich library of various core modules which are compiled into the binary distribution and load automatically when Node.js processes start. These modules provide foundational functionalities necessary for building scalable applications.

## 1. HTTP Module
The HTTP module is one of the key modules for creating web servers and handling HTTP requests and responses.

### Creating a Simple Web Server
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});
```
This example demonstrates how to create a basic web server that listens on port 3000.

## 2. File System Module (fs)
The File System module allows you to work with the file system on your computer.

### Reading a File Asynchronously
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log(data);
});
```
This function reads the contents of `example.txt` asynchronously, without blocking other operations.

## 3. Path Module
The Path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

### Example: Formatting Paths
```javascript
const path = require('path');

const filePath = path.join('/users/joe', 'test.txt');
console.log(filePath);
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `path.join` method to create a consistent file path across different operating systems.

## 4. Events Module
Node.js is built around an event-driven architecture, primarily using the EventEmitter class, which is part of the Events module.

### Example: Emitting and Handling Events
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!');
});
myEmitter.emit('event');
```
This example shows how to create an event emitter instance, listen for an "event", and trigger the event.

## Conclusion
These core modules form the backbone of many Node.js applications, providing essential functionalities that are needed for developing robust server-side logic. Understanding and utilizing these modules effectively can greatly enhance your application's performance and scalability.
